security.txt provides a way for websites to define security policies.
The security.txt file sets clear guidelines for security researchers on how to report security issues.
security.txt is the equivalent of `robots.txt`, but for security issues.

> ‚Äú When security vulnerabilities are discovered by researchers, proper reporting channels are often lacking.  As a result, vulnerabilities may be left unreported.  This document defines a format ("security.txt") to help organizations describe their vulnerability disclosure practices to make it easier for researchers to report vulnerabilities.‚Äù
